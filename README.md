canopy.TestPen
==============
This project actually works really well, but is not actively developed.

Sister project of canopy.  Its a test case management tool.  Has a DSL for defing test cases in f#.  Also has a web site for tracking runs of tests.

Still very much a WIP.  Should be version 0.1 soon.
